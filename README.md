# Caesar_Cypher

In the console, the code first asks the user if he wants to encrypt or decrypt, along theres a quit option to end the execution.
Independently which of the first two options get chosen, the console will ask, respectvely, for the word to be encrypted/decrypted, and a integer key.
And will return the final word with swapped letters.
